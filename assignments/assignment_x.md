# Assignment 4

For this assignment, you will need the background from these pages:

* [3.7 Arrays and axes](../chapters/03/arrays_and_axes.ipynb)
* [3.8 Reply to the Supreme Court](../chapters/03/reply_supreme.ipynb)

At the time I wrote this, you can find the following on the [Wikipedia
page for Burkitt's
Lymphoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkitt%27s_lymphoma#Prognosis).

> The overall cure rate for Burkitt's lymphoma in developed countries is
about > 90%, but worse in low-income countries. Burkitt's lymphoma is
uncommon in > adults, where it has a worse prognosis {%cite

How likely is it that these study results, or better, could have come
about by chance?

Use the tools that you see in [Reply to the Supreme
Court](../chapters/03/reply_supreme.ipynb).  You might consider copying that notebook to start.

For extra points - imagine that there were 10 labs doing this exact same
study, but the labs that didn't get results as good as this, did not
publish. In that case, this publication would have been the best of 10
tries to get good results.  In that case, what are the chances of seeing
results as good as these, or better?
