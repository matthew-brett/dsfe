# Arrays

While there are many kinds of collections in Python, we will work primarily
with arrays in this class.

The `numpy` package, abbreviated `np` in programs, provides Python programmers
with convenient and powerful functions for creating and manipulating arrays.

```{python}
import numpy as np
```

Arrays often contain numbers, but the can also contain strings or other types
of values.  However, a single array can only contain a single kind of data.
(It usually doesn't make sense to group together unlike data anyway.)

For example:

```{python}
english_parts_of_speech = np.array(["noun", "pronoun", "verb", "adverb", "adjective", "conjunction", "preposition", "interjection"])
english_parts_of_speech
```

Returning to the temperature data, we create arrays of average daily [high
temperatures](http://berkeleyearth.lbl.gov/auto/Regional/TMAX/Text/global-land-TMAX-Trend.txt)
for the decades surrounding 1850, 1900, 1950, and 2000.

```{python}
baseline_high = 14.48
highs = np.array([baseline_high - 0.880,
                  baseline_high - 0.093,
                  baseline_high + 0.105,
                  baseline_high + 0.684])
highs
```

Arrays can be used in arithmetic expressions to compute over their contents.
When an array is combined with a single number, that number is combined with
each element of the array. Therefore, we can convert all of these temperatures
to Fahrenheit by writing the familiar conversion formula.

```{python}
(9/5) * highs + 32
```

Arrays also have *methods*, which are functions that operate on the array
values. The `mean` of a collection of numbers is its average value: the sum
divided by the length. Each pair of parentheses in the examples below is part
of a call expression; it's calling a function with no arguments to perform a
computation on the array called `highs`.

```{python}
highs.size
```

```{python}
highs.sum()
```

```{python}
highs.mean()
```

#### Functions on Arrays

Numpy provides various useful functions for operating on arrays.

For example, the `diff` function computes the difference between each adjacent
pair of elements in an array. The first element of the `diff` is the second
element minus the first.

```{python}
np.diff(highs)
```

The [full Numpy reference](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/) lists
these functions exhaustively, but only a small subset are used commonly for
data processing applications. These are grouped into different packages within
`np`. Learning this vocabulary is an important part of learning the Python
language, so refer back to this list often as you work through examples and
problems.

However, you **don't need to memorize these**.  Use this as a reference.

Each of these functions takes an array as an argument and returns a single
value.

| **Function**       | Description                                                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `np.prod`          | Multiply all elements together                                       |
| `np.sum`           | Add all elements together                                            |
| `np.all`           | Test whether all elements are true values (non-zero numbers are true)|
| `np.any`           | Test whether any elements are true values (non-zero numbers are true)|
| `np.count_nonzero` | Count the number of non-zero elements                                |

Each of these functions takes an array as an argument and returns an array of values.

| **Function**       | Description                                                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `np.diff`          | Difference between adjacent elements                                 |
| `np.round`         | Round each number to the nearest integer (whole number)              |
| `np.cumprod`       | A cumulative product: for each element, multiply all elements so far |
| `np.cumsum`        | A cumulative sum: for each element, add all elements so far          |
| `np.exp`           | Exponentiate each element                                            |
| `np.log`           | Take the natural logarithm of each element                           |
| `np.sqrt`          | Take the square root of each element                                 |
| `np.sort`          | Sort the elements                                                    |

Each of these functions takes an array of strings and returns an array.

| **Function**        | **Description**                                              |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `np.char.lower`     | Lowercase each element                                       |
| `np.char.upper`     | Uppercase each element                                       |
| `np.char.strip`     | Remove spaces at the beginning or end of each element        |
| `np.char.isalpha`   | Whether each element is only letters (no numbers or symbols) |
| `np.char.isnumeric` | Whether each element is only numeric (no letters)  

Each of these functions takes both an array of strings and a *search string*; each returns an array.

| **Function**         | **Description**                                                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `np.char.count`      | Count the number of times a search string appears among the elements of an array |
| `np.char.find`       | The position within each element that a search string is found first             |
| `np.char.rfind`      | The position within each element that a search string is found last              |
| `np.char.startswith` | Whether each element starts with the search string
